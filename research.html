<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
 To connect employers with quality talent in the form of educated students Freelance provides students an opportunity to use their skills and earn an income while gaining valuable work experience. Employers benefit from a cost effective and scalable solution. Ultimately our goal is for the greater good of the  economy. As more  companies realize the benefit of hiring students on a freelance basis, they will be more inclined to insource their work rather than outsource it, and that will lead to lower unemployment and more job creation among  youths.
