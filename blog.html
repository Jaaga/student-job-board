          Feedback loops are an essential component in product development because these loops provide regular opportunities to learn and adjust the product to have better fit. Qualitative feedback loops enable you to better understand your customers. Prototyping is another powerful feedback loop in product development. As effective as these are, both qualitative feedback and prototyping are poorly suited to give feedback at scale—they are best done in one on one scenarios or small groups and often times in-person.
        </p>

        <p>However, one of the benefits to building products in the age of the internet is that we can do many things at scale that were previously not possible. This includes automated, remote, and statistically significant product feedback loops. This type of product feedback loop depends on having well-implemented data gathering and analytics.</p>
